# Udemy-HomePage-Clone
This is a static clone of the Udemy homepage, built entirely using HTML and CSS, as my first step into web development. The goal of the project was to replicate the look and layout of the original Udemy site, focusing on structure, layout design, and responsiveness without using any JavaScript or frameworks.
